Basic Economy Simulation with a small Ascii Map to go along with it.

## Created during a [livecoding.tv/angryalbino](https://www.livecoding.tv/angryalbino/) Stream.

## Screenshots

Console generation and display of a [`Map`](/EconomyTest/Map.cs), and round / turn-based simulation of a [`Market`](/EconomyTest/Economy/Market.cs) full of [`Agent`](/EconomyTest/Economy/Agent.cs)s

Each Turn, `Agent`s must consume some kind of `Food` (`Bread` counts) and some kind of `Water` (`Liquor` counts) to survive.

Starting with v0.1.2-alpha , `Agent`s will move around the `Map`.

Starting with v0.1.3-alpha , `Agent`s will Trade with each-other, and Loot dead `Agent`s.

When only one `Agent` is left surviving, they are marked as the winner.

Dead `Agent` are shown as a `-`, where as Alive ones are shown as a `+`.


## TODO

- `Map` should generate some items by defualt
- `Map` should use some ascii / colors to show different tiles
- `MapTile` with properties such as size other than `1x1`
- `MapObject` to support sizes larger than `1x1`

- `Map` Features (like River generation, water body generation)

- Special `Agent` implementation (abilities + items)

- More Items
- More Map Tiles
